# Data Structures and Algorithms Study

This repository contains the code and notes from my study on data structures and algorithms. Here, I have explored different concepts and techniques to enhance my understanding and skills in this fundamental area of computer science.

## Data Structures

- Index Access: I demonstrated how to access elements in an array using indices and how to add or remove elements.

- Fibonacci Sequence: I implemented the calculation of the Fibonacci sequence, which involves summing the two previous numbers to obtain the next number in the sequence.

## Algorithms

- Iteration: I used loops to iterate and print values from arrays, either to display the days of the week or the numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
